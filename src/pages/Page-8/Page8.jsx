          In our community, the most important thing is how consistently you do
          training and you commit to work out since when. Our purpose is
          building a habit for our lives. And building a habit is always easy to
          say, but very hard to do. Most people quit in couple weeks. That's
          why, baby steps are essential at the beginning.

          We have 2 main things to avoid. Firstly, the brain should not label
          the work as "boring". That's why, we challenge your body with
          different exercises, different methods every day and all workouts are
          constantly varied. We never let your brain default the work. Secondly,
          the brain should not label the work as "hard". That's why, all our
          workouts are adjustable and for all exercises we have scaling options.
          These make our workouts suitable for any people from any level of
          fitness. Also, during workouts control is always on your hands.
          Slowing down or speeding up is your choice. Those who have a good
          fitness level should rest less, new comers can rest more.
